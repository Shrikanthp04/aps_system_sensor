## Live APS SYSTEM SENSOR

**Problem statement :**
- The system in focus is the Air Pressure system (APS) which generates pressurized air that are utilized in various functions in a truck, such as braking and gear changes. The datasets positive class corresponds to component failures for a specific component of the APS system. The negative class corresponds to trucks with failures for components not related to the APS system.

- The problem is to reduce the cost due to unnecessary repairs. So it is required to minimize the false predictions.
